.USAGE
    There’s usually a pair of these settings required by STIGs —
Message text (this one)


Message title (WN11-SO-000070)


They often go hand-in-hand because one is the heading and the other is the body of the warning notice.

    Example syntax:
    PS C:\> .\_(STIG-ID-WN11-SO-000075).ps1 
#>

# Define the title (caption) and the message text
$caption = "U.S. Government Information System"
$message = @"
